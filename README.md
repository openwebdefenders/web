## Web Environment Integrity

The [Web Environment Integrity](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity) is a proposed standard by Google that introduces an API allowing browsers to verify the integrity of the web environment they operate in. This is done through attester verdicts, which are essentially “seals of approval” from trusted entities.

[This website](https://openwebdefenders.org) tries to explain what the proposal is about and how it is a threat to the openness of the web.
